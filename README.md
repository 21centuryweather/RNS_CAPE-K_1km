# RNS_CAPE-K_1km
An ACCESS regional nested suite run over Cape kennaook and Bass Strait, to target the [CAPE-K](https://www.arm.gov/research/campaigns/amf2024cape-k) region of interest and [offshore declared renewable wind regions](https://www.dcceew.gov.au/energy/renewable/offshore-wind/areas).

The nested domains might look similar to this, down to ~1 km grid spacing (using [UM_plot_domain_Cape-K](UM_plot_domain_Cape-K.ipynb) adapted from Scott Wales/Paul Gregory).
